Everyones going on an on about `@click`, `x-text`, and `$store`, but what about the Alpine globals!? Let's dive into some lesser known, but quite useful — dare I say powerful? — features of the Alpine API.

> I maintain the [`@types/alpinejs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/alpinejs) package. I've worked hard to properly Type and even document the Alpine API. Even if you're not using TypeScript, installing this package can give you helpful explanations of the API as you use these methods.

## `Alpine.reactive`

```ts
interface Alpine {
  reactive<T>(obj: T): T;
}
```

Underneath Alpine is the powerful `@vue/reactivity` package. When you make new components, or stores, or add values to existing components, Alpine wraps them in reactive proxies. You've probably seen this when trying to log an object from a component.

Well, you can use `Alpine.reactive` to make your own reactive objects! This is useful mainly for plugins that might want to hook into reactivity without waiting for values to exist in a component.

```js
import Alpine from 'alpinejs';

const data = Alpine.reactive({ count: 0 });
Alpine.effect(() => {
  console.log(data.count);
});
data.count++;
```

> `Alpine.effect` is also a way to register a reactive effect, like `x-effect` does.

### Bonus: `Alpine.raw`

```ts
interface Alpine {
  raw<T>(obj: T): T;
}
```

To clean up those Proxies in those logs, `Alpine.raw` does the opposite of `reactive`! It lets you simply access the internal object without concern for proxy wrapper. Can really make console debugging a lot easier.

```html
<button
  type="button"
  @click="
    console.log(Alpine.raw(cartItems))
  "></button>
```

## `Alpine.addRootSelector`

```ts
interface Alpine {
  addRootSelector(selectorCallback: () => string): void;
}
```

Ever make a fancy clean Headless Alpine component (like in `@alpinejs/ui`) but not enjoy the process of adding the `x-data` attribute to the elements, just to make them work? `addRootSelector` is here to help!

It basically adds new selectors for Alpine to initialize as if they are `x-data`, indicating the root of a new Alpine component. Just pass in a function that returns a css selector string.

```js
import Alpine from 'alpinejs';

Alpine.addRootSelector(() => `[${Alpine.prefixed('dialog')}]`);
```

```html
<dialog x-dialog>
  Alpine sure is cool!
</dialog>
```

> `Alpine.prefixed` is a helper to transform the attribute name to respect `Alpine.prefix` configuration.

### Bonus: `Alpine.addInitSelector`

```ts
interface Alpine {
  addInitSelector(selectorCallback: () => string): void;
}
```

Like `addRootSelector`, but for elements that you only want to evaluate as standalone actions. This is like `x-init`! `x-init` can be used [without being inside an `x-data`](https://alpinejs.dev/directives/init#standalone-x-init) to help run simple startup expressions.

## `Alpine.addScopeToNode`

```ts
interface Alpine {
  addScopeToNode(
    node: Element,
    data: Record<string, unknown>,
    referenceNode?: Element,
  ): () => void;
}
```

`addScopeToNode` is the JavaScript API equivalent to `x-data`! It allows your code to add new data to an element, for directives or children to access.

The optionally passed in `referenceNode` allows you to pass in a different node for the element to "inherit" from. This is useful for things like `x-teleport` where the element is somewhere else, but reactively interacts with a different component tree!

```js
import Alpine from 'alpinejs';

const el = document.querySelector('[x-data]');
const newPage = document.createElement('div');

Alpine.addScopeToNode(newPage, { page: 'home' }, el);

document.body.append(newPage);
```

> Note: `addScopeToNode` returns a function that can be called to remove the scope from the element. This is useful for cleanup in Single Page Applications.

### Bonus: `Alpine.$data`

```ts
interface Alpine {
  $data(node: Element): void;
}
```

This gets the data context of the element! It's the same way expressions access the data context. You get a flattened object of the entire data stack that expressions on that element can access.

```js
import Alpine from 'alpinejs';

const el = document.querySelector('button');

el.addEventListener('click', () => {
  if ('cart' in Alpine.$data(el)) console.log('Cart exists!');
  else console.log('No cart here!');
});
```

## Honourable Mentions

### `Alpine.throttle`

```ts
interface Alpine {
  throttle(callback: Function, wait: number): Function;
}
```

Sometimes you need to `throttle` a function, but you aren't using `@click.throttle`. Well, you can use the same underlying functionality with `Alpine.throttle`! Now you can have your functions run only once every so often.

```js
import Alpine from 'alpinejs';

const throttledLog = Alpine.throttle(
  (msg) => console.log('Message:', msg),
  1000,
);

throttledLog('Hello'); // logs
throttledLog('World'); // doesn't log
```

> It's also FULLY type safe! So the type of function that goes in is the type of function that comes out!

### `Alpine.debounce`

```ts
interface Alpine {
  debounce(callback: Function, wait: number): Function;
}
```

Just like the above, for `debounce`! Now you can have your functions run only after a certain amount of time has passed since the last call, always with just the last arguments passed in.

```js
import Alpine from 'alpinejs';

const debouncedLog = Alpine.debounce(
  (msg) => console.log('Latest Message:', msg),
  1000,
);

debouncedLog('Hello'); // doesn't log
debouncedLog('World'); // logs.... later
```

> Oh, and it's type safe too!

## Wrap Up

Theres a lot of amazing power in the Alpine API! While these aren't all things you should be diving into regularly, they can be very useful for providing clean interfaces to highly reusable components. Let me know if there's any you think are even better!
