# `x-toaster`

`x-toaster` defines a Toaster component. Toaster components are layouts used to display toasts! You can have multiple toasters on a page, each with their own configuration, and even apply filters on what toasts each toaster should handle. This can be useful for having a toast handle conventional toasts, and another to handle a kind of notifications panel.

## Usage

Simply add `x-toaster` to a template tag of your choice to define a toaster.
```html
<template x-toaster></template>
```

Without anything else, this will display all toasts with their default displays.

## Filtering Toasts

You can also filter toasts with modifiers! Simply add modifiers for the main types of toasts you want to handle.

```html
/* Only show success toasts */
<template x-toaster.success></template>

/* Only show error toasts */
<template x-toaster.error></template>
```

The categories are `success`, `error`, `info`.

You can even combine them!

```html
/* Only show success and error toasts */
<template x-toaster.success.error></template>
```

## Custom Configuration

You can also configure the toaster by supplying a configuration object to the `x-toaster` directive.

```html
<template x-toaster="{ position: 'bottom-left', duration: 3000 }"></template>
```

More information can be found on the [Configuration](/docs/toasts/2-configuration/toaster-options/) page.

Alternatively, you can also supply configurations for settings via attributes.

```html
<template x-toaster
  position="bottom-left"
  duration="3000"></template>
```
