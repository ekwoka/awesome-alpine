# Toaster Options

```ts
type ToasterOptions = {
  position?: string;
  reverseOrder?: boolean;
  containerStyle?: CSSStyleDeclaration;
  gap?: number;
  toastOptions?: ToastOptions;
};
```

## `position: string`

- default: `bottom-right`
- choices: `top-left`, `top-center`,`top-right`, `bottom-left`, `bottom-center`, `bottom-right`

Naturally controls the position of the Toaster on the screen.

## `reverseOrder: boolean`

- default: `false`

By default, newer toasts appear at the top of the stack. If you want them to appear at the bottom, set this to `true`. This is useful for toasts that are more like notifications.

## `containerStyle: CSSStyleDeclaration`

Overrides the default styles of the toaster container. This is useful if you want to change the basic layout of the toaster, without writing a full custom toaster.

## `gap: number`

- default: `0.5` (`rem`)

Adjusts the gap between toasts in the toaster. Number provided is in `rem`.

## `toastOptions: ToastOptions`

Provides new default values for all the toasts in this toaster (or in the App). Helpful to not need to set toast options on each and every toast.
