# Getting started with Alpine Toast

Alpine Toast is a great way to simply add nice toast and candybar notification to your AlpineJS project. Whether you want custom designs, or use the provided, you can manage it all easily with a simple interface inspired by [React Hot Toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/).

## Installation

In your terminal of choice:

```sh
pnpm add @awesome-alpine/toasts
```

In your AlpineJS setup module:

```ts
import Alpine from 'alpinejs';
import Toasts from '@awesome-alpine/toasts';

Alpine.plugin(Toasts);

Alpine.start();
```

## Adding Toaster

Alpine will need to know where and how to render the toasts. This is simply done by making a `template` element with the `x-toaster` directive. It doesn't even need to be in an `x-data`.

```html
<template x-toaster></template>
```

This will use all the defaults, but you can also configure the toaster with a few options, that you can check out on the `configuration` page.

## Triggering Toasts

Triggering toasts can be done easily from many places in your application.

Inside an Attribute Expression (with `$toast`):

```html
<button type="button" @click="$toast.info('Woah you clicked me!')">
  Show Info Toast
</button>
```

Inside a component method (this `this.$toast`):

```ts
Alpine.data('myComponent', () => ({
  showToast() {
    this.$toast.success('You did it!');
  }
}));
```

or from other JS (on `Alpine.$toast`):

```ts
document.addEventListener('error', () =>
  Alpine.$toast.error('Something went wrong!');
);
```
