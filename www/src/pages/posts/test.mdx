It's easy to get started. Just install the package and run the command.

## Example

```ts
<head>
  <meta charset='UTF-8' />
  <meta http-equiv='X-UA-Compatible' content='IE=edge' />
  <meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0' />
  <title>
    {Astro.props.frontmatter.title} - AwesomeAlpine
  </title>
</head>
```

Wow! that is easy!
